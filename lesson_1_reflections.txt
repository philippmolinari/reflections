How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It pointed exactly to the line which was changed between the two files.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because git treats the whole repository as one logical unit of work whereas other vcs like Google Docs consider one file to be the logical unit of work

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log can be used to see different commits that impacted the file. git diff will tell you the differences between the files that have been changed since two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You can easily go back to the last non-corrupted version by doing a git checkout.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I would like to use git for Java projects that I eventually will develop after having completed my Java course.
