What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git file gets created in the repository

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Always only add the file that belong to one logical change to the staging area. When finished you can use the commmand git diff --staged to compare the changes against the last commit from the repository to ensure there only changes that belong to the logical change you want to commit. Then commit your changes by using git commit.
